This repository contains a data-driven restaurant matching algorithm designed to support community-based organizations (CBOs) and food access initiatives in identifying optimal restaurant partners for meal distribution programs. The project focuses on aligning operational constraints, geographic coverage, and capacity considerations to create efficient, equitable, and scalable matching outcomes. By leveraging structured data and reproducible analytics, the work aims to reduce manual coordination while improving consistency and transparency in partner selection.

The core of the repository is a Python-based analytical workflow implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which ingests cleaned restaurant and program data, applies matching logic, and outputs ranked or filtered results that reflect program priorities. The approach emphasizes flexibility, allowing the matching criteria to be adapted as program needs evolve, whether that means prioritizing proximity, production capacity, dietary accommodations, or historical performance. This makes the tool suitable both for exploratory analysis and for integration into broader operational decision-making processes.

Beyond its immediate application, this repository is intended to serve as a foundation for future enhancements, including more advanced scoring methodologies, optimization techniques, and potential automation. All code is written with readability and reproducibility in mind, enabling collaborators, analysts, and stakeholders to understand, audit, and extend the logic with minimal friction. Ultimately, the project supports data-informed partnerships that strengthen food systems and improve service delivery to communities in need.

To use this repository, clone it locally and open the Jupyter Notebook in a Python environment with standard data science libraries installed (such as pandas, numpy, and jupyter). Update the input data paths as needed to point to your restaurant and program datasets, then run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the matching logic. The notebook produces intermediate outputs and final results that can be reviewed directly or exported for downstream analysis, reporting, or operational use.
